# 2D Projectile Motion Simulator

This is a Python application for simulating 2D projectile motion and visualizing the trajectories. You can input launch angle, initial velocity, and optionally, air resistance, and the application will plot the trajectory along with essential metrics.

## Features

- Simulate 2D projectile motion.
- Visualize trajectories on a matplotlib plot.
- Calculate and display key metrics: max height, range, and time of flight.
- Adjustable x-axis and y-axis ranges.
- Toggle grid lines on the plot.
- Clear the plot to start fresh.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2D-Projectile-Motion-Simulator.git

cd 2D-Projectile-Motion-Simulator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
1. Run the application (either through the [executable](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1pbAGaBIuTByd3pM5jP1sn2x5wyVmgiEH) or using the following command):
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Enter the launch angle, initial velocity, and optional air resistance (if needed).

3. Set the x-axis and y-axis ranges.

4. Click the "Generate" button to simulate the projectile motion.

5. Toggle grid lines on/off as needed.

6. Click the "Clear" button to clear the plot.
